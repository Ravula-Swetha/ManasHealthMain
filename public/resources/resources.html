                    <h1>Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)</h1>
                    <p>Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a relaxation technique that involves tensing and then gradually releasing different muscle groups to promote physical and mental relaxation. Developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson in the 1920s, PMR is based on the idea that mental calmness is associated with muscle relaxation. It's often used to manage stress, anxiety, and even insomnia. Here's how you can practice Progressive Muscle Relaxation:</p>

                        <p>Guided imagery, also known as visualization, is a relaxation technique that involves creating
                            a
                            mental image of a peaceful and calming place or scenario. The idea is to use your
                            imagination to
                            evoke positive sensory experiences, such as sights, sounds, and smells, to promote
                            relaxation and
                            reduce stress. Guided imagery is often used as a tool for relaxation, stress management, and
                            even as
                            a complementary therapy in healthcare. Here's how you can practice guided imagery:</p>

                        <p>Aromatherapy is a holistic healing practice that uses natural plant extracts, known as

                            to enhance physical, mental, and emotional well-being. These essential oils are derived from
                            various
                            parts of plants, including flowers, leaves, bark, stems, and roots. Aromatherapy is often
                            used in
                            conjunction with massage, meditation, or other relaxation techniques. Here's an overview of
                            key aspects
